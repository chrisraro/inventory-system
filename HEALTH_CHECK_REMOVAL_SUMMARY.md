# Health Check Functionality Removal Summary

This document summarizes the complete removal of health check functionality from the inventory system in preparation for Vercel deployment.

## Files Removed

1. `lib/health-check.ts` - Health check utility with database and authentication checks
2. `app/api/health/` - Empty directory for health check API routes

## Files Updated

1. `setup.bat` - Removed health check verification step and test execution
2. `setup.sh` - Removed health check verification step and test execution
3. `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation to reflect health check removal
4. `COMPLETE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation to reflect health check removal

## Changes Made

### 1. File Deletions
- Deleted the health check utility file that contained functions for checking database connectivity and Supabase authentication
- Removed the empty health API route directory

### 2. Script Updates
- Updated both Windows and Unix setup scripts to remove references to the health check endpoint
- Removed test execution steps from setup scripts since no test files exist in the project

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added a new section to CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md documenting the health check removal
- Updated COMPLETE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md to include health check functionality in the list of removed components

## Verification

- No references to health check functionality remain in the codebase
- No broken imports or references to the removed files
- Setup scripts no longer attempt to run non-existent tests
- Documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system

## Impact

The removal of health check functionality:
- Simplifies the codebase by removing unused features
- Eliminates potential deployment issues on Vercel
- Reduces the application's complexity
- Removes unnecessary dependencies on logger functionality

The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel without any health check related components.

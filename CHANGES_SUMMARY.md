# Summary of Changes to Fix Data Visibility and User Management Issues

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the issue where stockman users were seeing the same data as admin users and to restore user role management functionality.

## Issues Identified

1. **Data Visibility Issue**: Client-side functions in [lib/supabase.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts) were not filtering data based on user roles
2. **RLS Policies**: Database Row Level Security policies needed to be updated for proper data isolation
3. **User Management**: User management functionality was already implemented but needed verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Client-Side Data Filtering ([lib/supabase.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts))

Updated the following functions to respect user roles:
- [getProducts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts#L117-L140): Now fetches user profile and filters products based on role
- [getProduct](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts#L142-L165): Now ensures users can only access their own products unless they're admin
- [getStockMovements](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts#L187-L217): Now filters movements based on user role

### 2. Database RLS Policies ([supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql))

Created a new SQL script with updated Row Level Security policies:
- Admin users can view all products and stock movements
- Regular users can only view their own products and stock movements
- All users can create, update, and delete their own records

### 3. API Routes

Created a new API route for getting a single product that respects user roles:
- [app/api/products/get/[id]/route.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/api/products/get/%5Bid%5D/route.ts): Ensures proper access control for individual products

### 4. Authentication Context ([contexts/auth-context.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/contexts/auth-context.tsx))

Enhanced user profile fetching to check if user account is active:
- Added validation to ensure deactivated users cannot access the system

### 5. User Management Page ([app/admin/users/page.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/admin/users/page.tsx))

Verified and slightly optimized the existing user management functionality:
- Ensured proper data fetching for admin users

### 6. Documentation Updates

Updated documentation to reflect the changes:
- [README.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/README.md): Added information about data visibility rules and troubleshooting
- [FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md): Created detailed instructions for applying the fixes
- [CHANGES_SUMMARY.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md): This document

## How the Fixes Work

### Data Visibility
1. When a user accesses the system, their role is determined from the `user_profiles` table
2. Client-side functions now check the user's role before fetching data
3. Admin users see all data, while stockman users only see their own data
4. Database RLS policies provide an additional layer of security

### User Management
1. Admin users can access the user management page at `/admin/users`
2. They can view all users in the system
3. They can change user roles between admin and stockman
4. They can activate/deactivate user accounts

## Testing the Fixes

### Data Visibility
1. Log in as an admin user (admin@petrogreen.com)
   - Should see all products and stock movements
2. Log in as a stockman user (stockman@petrogreen.com)
   - Should only see products and stock movements they created

### User Management
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin â†’ User Management
3. Verify you can see all users and change their roles

## Files Modified

1. [lib/supabase.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts) - Updated client-side data filtering
2. [contexts/auth-context.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/contexts/auth-context.tsx) - Enhanced user profile validation
3. [app/admin/users/page.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/admin/users/page.tsx) - Minor optimization
4. [app/api/products/get/[id]/route.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/api/products/get/%5Bid%5D/route.ts) - New API route for single product access
5. [supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql) - Database RLS policies
6. [README.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/README.md) - Documentation updates
7. [FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Fix instructions
8. [CHANGES_SUMMARY.md](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md) - This document

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL script [supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql) in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test the application with both admin and stockman users
3. Verify that user management functionality works correctly
4. Update any existing documentation as needed

These changes ensure proper data isolation while maintaining the functionality needed for both admin and stockman users.

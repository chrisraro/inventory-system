# QR Code Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of QR code filtering to extract the last alphanumeric word from QR codes for use as product identifiers. This addresses the issue where QR codes contain additional text or formatting that needs to be stripped to get the actual product identifier.

## Problem
QR codes may contain additional text or formatting that is not part of the actual product identifier. For example:
- "Q.C PASSED   05285AWI1ES04" should extract "05285AWI1ES04"
- Other QR codes may have prefixes, suffixes, or additional information

## Solution
Implemented a filtering mechanism that:
1. Extracts the last alphanumeric word from QR codes
2. Uses this extracted word as the product identifier throughout the system
3. Applies consistently to both add item and stock movements functionality

## Implementation Details

### 1. Utility Functions (`lib/qr-utils.ts`)
Created utility functions to handle QR code normalization:
- `extractLastAlphanumericWord()`: Extracts the last alphanumeric word from a QR code string
- `normalizeQRCode()`: Normalizes QR code data by extracting the product identifier
- `hasAlphanumericCharacters()`: Validates if a string contains alphanumeric characters

### 2. API Routes
Updated API routes to use normalized QR codes:
- `app/api/products/check-qr/route.ts`: Uses normalized QR code for product lookup
- `app/api/products/create/route.ts`: Uses normalized QR code for product creation

### 3. Frontend Components
Updated frontend components to use normalized QR codes:
- `app/stock-movements/page.tsx`: Normalizes QR codes in both scanning and manual entry
- `app/add-item/page.tsx`: Normalizes QR codes in both scanning and manual entry
- `components/qr/qr-code-scanner.tsx`: Normalizes QR codes in the shared scanner component

## How It Works

### QR Code Normalization Process
1. When a QR code is scanned or entered manually, it's passed to the `normalizeQRCode()` function
2. The function extracts the last alphanumeric word using `extractLastAlphanumericWord()`
3. This normalized identifier is used throughout the system for product identification

### Example Processing
- Input: "Q.C PASSED   05285AWI1ES04"
- Process: Split by whitespace → ["Q.C", "PASSED", "05285AWI1ES04"] → Take last part with alphanumeric chars → "05285AWI1ES04"
- Output: "05285AWI1ES04"

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All QR code processing uses the same normalization approach
2. **Reliability**: Handles various QR code formats and additional text
3. **Compatibility**: Works with existing product database using normalized identifiers
4. **User Experience**: Reduces errors from manually cleaning QR code data

## Testing
The implementation was tested with various QR code formats:
- "Q.C PASSED   05285AWI1ES04" → "05285AWI1ES04" ✓
- "LPG-12345" → "LPG-12345" ✓
- "  ABC123  " → "ABC123" ✓
- "Multiple Words Here XYZ789" → "XYZ789" ✓

## Files Modified
1. `lib/qr-utils.ts` - Created utility functions
2. `app/api/products/check-qr/route.ts` - Updated to use normalized QR codes
3. `app/api/products/create/route.ts` - Updated to use normalized QR codes
4. `app/stock-movements/page.tsx` - Updated QR code handling
5. `app/add-item/page.tsx` - Updated QR code handling
6. `components/qr/qr-code-scanner.tsx` - Updated QR code handling
7. `scripts/test-qr-utils.js` - Created test script

## Usage
The filtering is automatically applied whenever QR codes are scanned or entered manually in:
- Add Item page
- Stock Movements page
- Any component using the shared QR scanner

All product identifiers in the database will now be stored as normalized QR codes, ensuring consistency in lookups.

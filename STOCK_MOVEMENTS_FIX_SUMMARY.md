# Stock Movements Page Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes and improvements made to the stock movements page to resolve the QR scanning issue and improve mobile UI/UX.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QR Code Scanning Issue
**Problem**: When scanning or manually entering a registered product QR code on the stock movements page, the system couldn't fetch the product correctly.

**Root Cause**: The QR code checking API endpoint (`/api/products/check-qr`) was filtering products by user ID, which meant stockman users could only access products they created themselves. For stock movements, any authenticated user should be able to scan any product in the system.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `/app/api/products/check-qr/route.ts` to remove the user ID filter
- Now any authenticated user can check any product in the system by QR code
- This allows stockman users to scan products created by other users

**Problems Identified**:
- Layout was not responsive on mobile devices
- QR scanner UI was not optimized for mobile

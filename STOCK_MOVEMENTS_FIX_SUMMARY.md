# Stock Movements and User Management Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issues with stock movements visibility and user management navigation.

## Issues Identified

1. **Stock Movements Visibility**: Stockman users were seeing movements created by other stockman users
2. **User Management Navigation**: Admin users didn't have a visible link to the User Management page
3. **Created By Field**: Stock movements were not properly recording the user who created them

## Fixes Applied

### 1. User Management Navigation ([components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx))

Added a "User Management" link to the navigation sidebar that is only visible to admin users:
- Added `Users` icon from lucide-react
- Created `adminNavigation` array with the User Management link
- Modified the navigation logic to include admin-specific links for admin users
- The link points to `/admin/users` and requires the "manage_users" permission

### 2. Fixed Created By Field ([lib/supabase.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts))

Updated the [createStockMovement](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts#L222-L241) function to properly record the user who created the movement:
- Removed the hardcoded "admin" value for [created_by](file://c:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\inventory-system\app\stock-movements\page.tsx#L42-L42)
- Now fetches the current user's profile to get their actual user ID
- Uses the real user ID when creating stock movements

### 3. Verified API Route Filtering ([app/api/stock-movements/simplified/route.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/api/stock-movements/simplified/route.ts))

Confirmed that the stock movements API route correctly filters data based on user roles:
- Admin users can see all movements
- Regular users (stockman) can only see movements they created
- The filtering is done both in the API and enforced by RLS policies

### 4. Verified RLS Policies ([supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/supabase_scripts/05_complete_rls_fix.sql))

Confirmed that the database RLS policies are correctly set up:
- Admin users can view all stock movements via `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')`
- Regular users can only view movements where `auth.uid() = created_by`

## How the Fixes Work

### Stock Movements Visibility
1. When a user creates a stock movement, their actual user ID is recorded in the `created_by` field
2. When fetching movements, the API checks the user's role:
   - Admin users see all movements
   - Stockman users only see movements where `created_by` matches their user ID
3. Database RLS policies provide an additional layer of security

### User Management Navigation
1. Admin users now see a "User Management" link in the sidebar
2. The link is only visible to users with the "admin" role
3. Clicking the link takes users to `/admin/users` where they can manage other users

## Files Modified

1. [components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx) - Added User Management navigation for admin users
2. [lib/supabase.ts](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts) - Fixed [createStockMovement](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts#L222-L241) to use real user ID

## Testing the Fixes

### Stock Movements Visibility
1. Log in as a stockman user
2. Create a few stock movements
3. Log in as a different stockman user
4. Verify that you only see movements created by the current user
5. Log in as an admin user
6. Verify that you see all movements from all users

### User Management Navigation
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Verify that "User Management" appears in the sidebar
3. Click the link and verify that the user management page loads
4. Log in as a stockman user
5. Verify that "User Management" does NOT appear in the sidebar

## Additional Notes

The fixes ensure proper data isolation while maintaining the functionality needed for both admin and stockman users:
- Stockman users can only see and manage their own data
- Admin users have full visibility and management capabilities
- User management is accessible only to admin users
- All changes are backward compatible and don't affect existing functionality

# Stock Movements Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem
The stock movements functionality was encountering an error "Product is already in the specified status" when trying to record movements. This was happening due to issues with how the product lookup and status validation were handled.

## Root Causes
1. Incorrect product ID handling in the stock movements API
2. Improper status validation that wasn't accounting for the simplified system's QR code structure
3. Inconsistent error handling between QR scanning and manual entry
4. Missing proper feedback for users when trying to set a product to its current status

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Stock Movements API Route (`app/api/stock-movements/simplified/route.ts`)
- Fixed product lookup to correctly use the QR code as the product ID in the simplified system
- Improved status validation to prevent setting a product to its current status
- Enhanced error responses with more specific information
- Removed manual product status update since it's handled by the database trigger
- Added better error handling for database constraint violations

### 2. Updated Stock Movements Page (`app/stock-movements/page.tsx`)
- Improved `handleSubmit` function with better error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced `handleQRDetected` function to properly handle QR code scanning and product lookup
- Updated `handleManualQRSubmit` function for consistency with QR scanning
- Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Improved form reset behavior

### 3. Key Improvements
- **Product Lookup**: Now correctly uses the QR code as the product ID in the simplified system
- **Status Validation**: Prevents users from setting a product to its current status with clear feedback
- **Error Handling**: Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **User Experience**: Better feedback and guidance when operations fail
- **Consistency**: Unified handling between QR scanning and manual entry

## How It Works Now

1. **QR Scanning**: 
   - Camera scans QR code
   - System looks up product by ID (which is the QR code in the simplified system)
   - If found, opens movement form with product details
   - If not found, shows error and allows retry

2. **Manual Entry**:
   - User enters QR code manually
   - System looks up product by ID (which is the QR code)
   - If found, opens movement form with product details
   - If not found, shows error

3. **Movement Recording**:
   - Validates that required fields are filled
   - Checks that product exists
   - Ensures new status is different from current status
   - Creates movement record in database
   - Database trigger automatically updates product status
   - Shows success message and refreshes movement list

## Testing
To test the fixed functionality:
1. Scan a valid QR code that exists in the system
2. Try to set the product to a different status - should succeed
3. Try to set the product to its current status - should show error
4. Try to scan or enter a QR code that doesn't exist - should show error
5. Try to submit without filling required fields - should show validation error

## Database Schema Notes
In the simplified system:
- `products_simplified.id` is the QR code itself
- `products_simplified.qr_code` is also the QR code (duplicate field for clarity)
- Status changes are tracked in `stock_movements_simplified`
- Product status is automatically updated by database trigger when movement is recorded

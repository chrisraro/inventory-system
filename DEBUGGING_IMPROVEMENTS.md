# Debugging Improvements Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/api/products/check-qr/route.ts`
- Added detailed logging to see what QR code is being received
- Added fallback checks by both QR code and ID fields
- Added checks for both trimmed and original QR code values
- Enhanced error logging

### 2. `app/stock-movements/page.tsx`
- Added comprehensive logging in `handleQRDetected` to see what QR code is detected
- Added character code analysis to identify special characters
- Added logging of URL encoding to check for encoding issues
- Added fallback request without URL encoding
- Added consistent debugging in `handleManualQRSubmit`
- Added character analysis for manual input as well

### 3. `app/api/products/create/route.ts`
- Added logging to see what QR code is being stored
- Enhanced duplicate checking to check both ID and QR code fields
- Added logging of the created product

### 4. `scripts/debug-products.js`
- Created a comprehensive debug script to check what products exist in the database
- Added character code analysis to identify special characters in stored products
- Added movement checking to verify system functionality

## Debugging Features Added

1. **Character Analysis**: All QR code inputs are now analyzed for special characters and encoding issues
2. **Multiple Lookup Attempts**: The system now tries multiple approaches to find products
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs are added at every step of the process
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: URL encoding issues are handled with fallback requests
5. **Database Verification**: Script to verify what's actually stored in the database

## How to Use the Debugging Tools

### 1. Browser Console Debugging
When scanning or entering QR codes, check the browser console for detailed logs including:
- Detected QR code data
- Character codes analysis
- API request URLs
- API response data

### 2. Database Debugging
Run the debug script to see what's actually in the database:
```bash
node scripts/debug-products.js
```

This will show:
- All products in the database
- Character analysis of stored QR codes
- Sample stock movements

## Common Issues to Look For

1. **Special Characters**: Non-ASCII characters that might not be handled correctly
2. **Whitespace**: Leading/trailing spaces that might cause mismatches
3. **URL Encoding**: Characters that might be incorrectly encoded/decoded
4. **Case Sensitivity**: Mixed case that might cause lookup failures
5. **Database Schema Mismatches**: Differences between stored and expected formats

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting

1. Scan a QR code and check the browser console logs
2. Run the debug script to verify database contents
3. Compare the character codes between scanned data and stored data
4. Check for any encoding discrepancies
5. Verify that the QR code format matches what's expected by the system

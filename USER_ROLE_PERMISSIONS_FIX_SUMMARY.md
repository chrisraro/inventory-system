# User Role Permissions and Session Management Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix user role permissions and session management issues in the inventory system.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. User Role Permissions
**Problem**: 
- Stockman users could only see and edit their own products and movements
- Admin users had proper deletion permissions, but stockman users couldn't delete any products

**Requirements**:
- All stockman users should be able to oversee stocks made by other stockman users
- All stockman users should be able to edit products added by other stockman users
- Admin users should be able to overwrite (delete) products added by all stockman users

### 2. Session Management
**Problem**: 
- Users were automatically logged out when they left the browser or reloaded the web app
- Session persistence was not properly maintained

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
- Updated PERMISSIONS mapping to allow stockman users to delete products
- Maintained existing session management with Supabase auth state change listeners
- No changes needed to session persistence as Supabase already handles this properly

### 2. Supabase Library (`lib/supabase.ts`)
- **getProducts()**: Removed user-specific filtering so stockman users can see all products
- **getProduct()**: Removed user-specific filtering so stockman users can access any product
- **updateProduct()**: Removed user-specific filtering so stockman users can update any product
- **deleteProduct()**: Removed user-specific filtering so stockman users can delete any product
- **getStockMovements()**: Removed user-specific filtering so stockman users can see all movements

### 3. Product Deletion API (`app/api/products/delete/[id]/route.ts`)
- Removed user-specific permission checks
- Both admin and stockman users can now delete any product
- Maintained proper authentication requirements

### 4. Stock Movements API (`app/api/stock-movements/simplified/route.ts`)
- Removed user-specific filtering in GET endpoint
- Both admin and stockman users can now see all stock movements
- Maintained proper authentication requirements
- Updated POST endpoint to allow both roles to access any product

## Implementation Details

### User Permissions Matrix
| Role | View Products | Edit Products | Delete Products | View Movements | Create Movements |
|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Admin | All | All | All | All | All |
| Stockman | All | All | All | All | All |

### Session Management
- No changes were needed to session management as Supabase already provides proper session persistence
- Sessions are maintained through localStorage and automatically refreshed
- The existing auth context implementation properly handles token refresh and user profile updates

## Verification

The changes have been implemented to ensure:
- Stockman users can view, edit, and delete products created by other stockman users
- Admin users can view, edit, and delete products created by any user
- Session persistence works correctly - users are not automatically logged out on page reload
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Proper authentication is still enforced for all operations

## Impact

These changes improve:
- Collaboration between stockman users by allowing them to manage each other's products
- Admin oversight capabilities by allowing deletion of any product
- User experience by maintaining persistent sessions
- System usability by removing unnecessary access restrictions

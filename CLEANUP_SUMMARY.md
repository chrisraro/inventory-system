# Inventory System Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the systematic cleanup of the inventory system based on the documented changes.

## 1. Database Schema Cleanup

### Changes Made:
- Removed the obsolete [use-qr-codes.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/hooks/use-qr-codes.ts) hook that was using the old QR system
- Updated [lib/supabase.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts) to remove all QR code functions and references
- Cleaned up the backup page to remove QR code restoration functionality
- Removed obsolete SQL scripts related to the old database schema

### Verification:
- The system now uses only `products_simplified` and `stock_movements_simplified` tables
- All API routes have been updated to use the simplified table names
- QR functionality is now properly integrated with the products_simplified table

## 2. Authentication System Cleanup

### Changes Made:
- Verified that all authentication is properly implemented with Supabase Auth
- Confirmed user profiles with role management (Admin and Stock Manager roles) are working
- Verified Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place
- Confirmed permission-based access control system is functioning

### Verification:
- Authentication context is properly implemented in [contexts/auth-context.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/contexts/auth-context.tsx)
- Login page uses Supabase authentication instead of hardcoded credentials
- No localStorage-based session management remains

## 3. Build Error Fixes

### Changes Made:
- Verified that all @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs imports have been resolved
- Confirmed API routes use the existing Supabase client pattern
- Standardized import patterns across all API routes

### Verification:
- No build errors remain
- All API routes are using the proper Supabase client authentication
- No references to obsolete auth-helpers remain

## 4. QR-Based System Implementation

### Changes Made:
- Enhanced QR scanner with mobile back camera support in [app/qr-scanner/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/qr-scanner/page.tsx)
- Created new product creation flow based on QR codes as primary keys in [app/add-item/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/add-item/page.tsx)
- Updated stock movements to work with QR-based product IDs in [app/stock-movements/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/stock-movements/page.tsx)
- Streamlined the user interface to focus on QR scanning workflow

### Verification:
- QR scanner properly detects QR codes and checks them against the database
- New product creation flow works with QR codes as primary keys
- Stock movements are properly tracked with QR-based product IDs
- Status-based tracking system is fully implemented

## 5. Codebase Organization

### Files Removed:
- [hooks/use-qr-codes.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/hooks/use-qr-codes.ts) - Obsolete hook for old QR system
- [DATABASE_MIGRATION_REQUIRED.md](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/DATABASE_MIGRATION_REQUIRED.md) - Obsolete documentation
- [QR_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/QR_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Obsolete documentation
- [RECOVERY_AND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/RECOVERY_AND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) - Obsolete documentation
- [supabase_scripts/05_cleanup_obsolete_tables.sql](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/supabase_scripts/05_cleanup_obsolete_tables.sql) - Obsolete SQL script
- Several obsolete SQL scripts in the [scripts/](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/scripts) directory

### Files Updated:
- [app/backup/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/app/backup/page.tsx) - Removed QR code references
- [lib/supabase.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/lib/supabase.ts) - Removed obsolete QR functions
- [README.md](file:///c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/inventory-system/README.md) - Updated to reflect current system

### Verification:
- All obsolete files have been removed
- Documentation accurately reflects the current system
- Codebase is organized with clear separation of concerns
- No references to the old system remain

## Conclusion

The inventory system has been successfully cleaned up and is now fully aligned with the documented simplified QR-based cylinder tracking system. All obsolete components have been removed, and the system is functioning properly with:

- Status-based inventory management
- QR code integration as the primary product identifier
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Clean codebase organization
- No build errors or obsolete references
